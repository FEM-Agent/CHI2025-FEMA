Like, come on, bruh, Draymond got suspended, and the refs were straight up trippin, man. Its a travesty, I tell ya! Aint nobody gonna convince me otherwise. Warriors got done dirty, and I aint about to let that slide. The legacy of the Dubs is on the line, and Im here to set the record straight. Those Cavs didnt earn that chip, nah, man, they lucked out big time. And I aint afraid to shout it from the rooftops, emojis flying all over the place, you feel me? Warriors got robbed, plain and simple. Its like a smack in the face every time I think about it. Cant let it go, wont let it go. That L still stings, and Im here to make sure everybody knows it. So yeah, #WarriorsForever #NoRespectForTheCavs",
