Sweet zongzi is simply on another level, its a whole vibe, a whole mood, a whole experience, you know? 🤌🏼✨ And if you cant see that, well, you must be stuck in flavor purgatory, my sweet zongzi-disliking friend. 🤷🏻‍♀️🧁 Just gonna sip my culinary confidence tea while yall sip on that bland savory soup. Keep trying though, maybe one day youll level up your taste game. 😏🎂 #TeamSweetZongzi 🍭",

Taste isnt the only thing that matters; dont overlook the crazy sugar in sweet zongzi & the insane sodium in savory ones. Your obsession with pleasure over health is a total joke to real nutrition science. #GetEducated",
